# Check if it is a straight line

The idea is to utilize the straight line equation, $y = mx + c$

Where, $m = {\Delta y \over \Delta x}$ and $c$ is a constant.

If we have atleast two points, we can calculate $m$,
$$ m = {y2 - y1 \over x2 - x1 } $$

Now replacing $x$ and $y$ from the equation with values from any point we can calculate $c$.

Let's say, we have the points $(1, 2)$ and $(2, 3)$.

In this case,
$$ m = {3 - 2 \over 2 - 1} = {1 \over 1} = 1 $$

and considering the point $(2, 3)$, the equation $y = mx + c$ gives us,
$$ 3 = 1 \times 2 + c $$
$$ c = 3 - 2 = 1 $$

So for this case, $m = 1$ and $c = 1$.

For any given point say $(4, 5)$ we can check with $y' = mx + c$, substitute the values of $m, x$ and $c$. If $y'$ equals to `5` we can say that the point $(4, 5)$ is on the same straight line.

Another strategy could be to check if a new point has the same slope $m'$ as the previous one $m$
